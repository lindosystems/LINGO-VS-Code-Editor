# LINGO VS code Editor

This is the official LINGO VS code editor extension. It features syntax highlighting, auto complete, and can run LINGO models. This extension works on .LNG files and not .LG4.

## Run LINGO
For the `Run LINGO` feature to work you must [have the latest version of LINGO 21](https://lindo.com/index.php/ls-downloads/try-lingo) installed on your computer. When a .LNG file is open a `Run LINGO` button will appear in the top right corner.
