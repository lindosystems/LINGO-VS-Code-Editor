## Editor Features
Syntax highlighting, auto-completion and hover text are essential for most language extensions. These features boost productivity, enabling users to conduct more rapid research and development. The LINGO VS Code editor extension tailors these features specifically to the LINGO modeling language.

### Auto Complete
The auto-complete feature includes each LINGO function, logical operator and section name. Additionally, every set name, along with all their attributes and variables, is covered. Lastly, the extension includes templates for each set looping function, complete with the set name and an iterator.
